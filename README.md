# pilo

a small interpreted stack-based language i made because i was bored.

current implemented instructions:

`+` - pops the top two numbers on the stack and pushes their sum
`puts` - pops the top number on the stack and prints it
`dump` - prints the whole stack
`pop` - pops the top number on the stack
